# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

**Intern Name:** Rahul Malatesh Sannapujar
**Date Completed:** 30/09/2025
**Objective:** Capture live network packets, identify basic protocols and traffic types, and summarize findings to demonstrate hands-on packet analysis skills.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Environment

* **Primary Tool:** Wireshark (free, open-source network protocol analyzer).
* **Operating System:** Linux/VM (as suggested by the `eth0` interface and standard Wireshark theme).
* **Traffic Generation:** Traffic was generated by performing routine tasks such as browsing secure websites, executing diagnostic pings, and engaging in local network activity.

## üìù Summary of Findings

The captured network traffic successfully demonstrated the operation of five fundamental protocols across different layers of the network stack.

### 1. Protocols Identified

The following protocols were captured and filtered for analysis:

* **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol)
* **TLSv1.2/TLSv1.3** (Transport Layer Security)
* **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol)
* **ICMP** (Internet Control Message Protocol)
* **ARP** (Address Resolution Protocol)

### 2. Key Network Events Captured

The analysis confirms the following activities were taking place on the network interface:

* **Encrypted Web Traffic (TCP/TLS):** Analysis showed multiple **TCP three-way handshakes** followed immediately by **TLSv1.3 Client Hello** messages, confirming the use of secure (HTTPS) communication. This traffic included encrypted data flows and session termination (via `FIN` flags).
* **Network Diagnostics (ICMP):** A diagnostic test was executed, clearly revealing the paired packets of **`ICMP Echo (ping) request`** and **`ICMP Echo (ping) reply`** to a public IP address (`72.163.4.185`).
* **Local Address Resolution (ARP):** Continuous **`ARP who has`** broadcast requests were observed, essential for resolving local IP addresses to physical MAC addresses for device-to-device communication within the local segment.
* **Connectionless Data (UDP):** Traffic was identified using the **UDP** protocol, typical for quick, non-guaranteed data transfer such as DNS queries.

## üñºÔ∏è Deliverables

* `Task_5_Capture.pcap`: The raw packet capture file (not included here, but should be added to the repository).
* **Screenshots:** Images validating the filtered traffic for ARP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, and TLS (as submitted).
* `README.md`: This summary of findings and methodology.

## üîë Outcome

This task successfully achieved hands-on experience in **packet capture**, **protocol filtering** (`arp`, `icmp`, `udp`, `tcp.port==80`), and **protocol analysis**, providing foundational skills necessary for network troubleshooting and security monitoring.
